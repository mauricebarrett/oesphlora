Currently under preparation.


## Installation

There are two ways to set up this project:

---

### Option 1: Docker (all-in-one)

The easiest way is to use the prebuilt Docker image, which already contains **pixi**, **fqkit**, and all required dependencies.



### Option 2: Native installation

This project uses [pixi](https://pixi.sh) for environment management.  
Most dependencies are handled automatically by pixi.

#### Step 1: Install pixi
Follow the [pixi installation guide](https://pixi.sh/latest/#installation)

⚠️ **Important:** Some tools are a system dependency and **cannot be installed through pixi**.  
You must install it separately before using reproducing analysis


### Install `fqkit`
